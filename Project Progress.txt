I was occupied with Major Sitecore release so could not get much time to work on the test.
However,I am pusing the changes that I have implemented so far.

Will try to work on the test cases in the next availble time slot.

Note: As I could not install SQLite on my office laptop due to some security issues, system does not allow me to install so used SQL Server.


Not included:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. Logging
4. Test cases

To Run the application:
1. Make sure the Web API url of your hosting server is added to the WebApiConfig file.
2. If using SQL Server - Run the following EF migration commands in Package Manager Console to add default AgeGroup reecords.Should be run only once
	add-migration initial -ignorechanges
	update-database
